# hello-world
Going through the motions of github's tutorial.
Here the leading 'g' was replaced with 'G'.

This edit was done a few moments after the repository was opened.   I'm continuing on this line to see if the text wraps to the next line or goes over the edge of the world.    

Now I see the text wraps but the line number stays the same.

This tells you a little bit about me.  I'd rather do a quick experiment and discover behavior than go to an authority or document
to ascertain the operative behavior of any thing.   This applies to most fields but not chemistry, high voltages and marriage.

Gosh,  I seem to have a choice of wrap style in the github editor.  Very good!
